This is a practice ground to learn open-source LLM (like, OpenAI, etc.) integration with different projects.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```


## Usage

Each directory has its own readme file configure API tokens, setting up environment variables, and creating a LangChain LLM instance for both Hugging Face and OpenAI models.

### 1. Setting up API Tokens

Obtain your API tokens from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).


### Notes
Make sure to replace `your_huggingface_token` and `your_openai_api_key` with actual API tokens.
For additional functionality and options, refer to the LangChain documentation.
